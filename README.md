# EdgeAI PayPoint Fraud Detection Demo

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates how **Edge AI** can be applied to **PayPoint barcode deposits** for fraud detection.
Instead of sending all transactions to the cloud, an **ONNX-based anomaly detection model** runs locally to provide real-time classification (Fraudulent / Legit).
Additionally, a **cloud-based LLM (Grok)** provides reasoning to explain the decision in natural language.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Simulates a **PayPoint deposit workflow**
* **Edge AI fraud detection** with `IsolationForest` converted to ONNX
* **Streamlit app** for interactive UI
* **Hybrid reasoning**: Edge ML for decision, Cloud LLM for explanation

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.10+**
* **scikit-learn**
* **skl2onnx**
* **onnxruntime**
* **Streamlit**
* **OpenRouter (Grok LLM)**

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/edgeai-paypoint-demo.git
cd edgeai-paypoint-demo
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # (Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt

## ▶️ Run the Demo

```bash
streamlit run app/paypoint_edgeai_app.py
```

---

## 💡 Example Use Case

* Alice generates a **barcode** in her Lloyds banking app
* She visits a PayPoint shop and deposits **£50**
* Edge AI at PayPoint instantly classifies the transaction
* If flagged as suspicious, the cloud LLM (Grok) provides reasoning:
  *“The deposit was unusually high for the time of day and location, suggesting possible mule activity.”*

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Integration with real PayPoint APIs
* Richer fraud signals (device, location, velocity)
* Model updates pushed securely from the cloud
