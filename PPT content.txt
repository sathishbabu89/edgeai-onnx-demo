### **Slide 1: Problem Statement**

#### **Fraudulent Transactions in Payment Systems**

* **Challenge**: Increasing cases of fraud in digital payment systems, especially with **PayByLink** transactions.
* **Current Gap**: Traditional fraud detection methods rely heavily on **cloud-based** systems, resulting in **latency** and **dependence on connectivity**.
* **Pain Points**:

  * **Time Lag**: Cloud-based fraud detection introduces delays in transaction processing.
  * **User Experience**: Slow response time impacts customer satisfaction.
  * **Data Privacy**: Cloud-based solutions often require sending sensitive data to the server for analysis.

#### **Impact on Customers and Banks**:

* **For Customers**: Increased transaction rejection, inconvenience, and potential financial loss.
* **For Banks**: Increased operational costs and reputational damage due to fraud.

### **Slide 2: Solution Overview**

#### **Edge AI for Real-Time Fraud Detection**

* **What is Edge AI?**

  * Fraud detection using **machine learning models** directly on customer **mobile devices**, eliminating dependence on cloud processing for real-time decisions.

* **Key Features**:

  * **Local Decision-Making**: Fraud detection happens **instantly** on the customerâ€™s mobile app.
  * **Offline Capability**: Decisions can be made even with no internet connectivity.
  * **AI-Powered Detection**: Uses an **ONNX machine learning model** that flags transactions as **legit** or **fraudulent**.

* **How it Works**:

  * The customer initiates a payment request.
  * The app analyzes the transaction **locally** using the **Edge AI model**.
  * The fraud detection outcome is provided instantly, ensuring a seamless user experience.
